I have always fought change, I think some of us are predisposed to feel unaligned when drastic changes occur in an abrupt manner. From the smallest of changes to those with greater impact, I struggle to naturally adapt to them. It can be quite a detrimental weight on ones shoulders thus diminishing the excitement and potential of what change can bring. I took a huge leap of faith in myself by jumping out of my safe zone and diving head first into a very intense change of career. 

My journey thus far has been tumoltous at best, but I have not given up. I have been so held back by the fear of change that I haven't been able to detach myself from it, distancing myself from the road block that procures itself, impeding my progress. Once I figured this out, it seemed easier to get used to the idea of change because I now knew where the problem lay, and what the root of it was. I don't think I'll ever be truly free of it, but it won't ever hold me back from progressing and moving forward. 

I have come to embrace change as a way to challenge myself and push my capabilities while simultaneously allowing myself to accept failures and defeats. Change has allowed me to truly invest in different areas of myself I didn't even know I had. In retrospect it's not just the fear of change, it was multifaceted fear that consisted of the fear of failure, fear of regret, fear of disappointment. It all roots from fear. I still do, I still fear but now I'm ok with it. I'm comfortable of knowing what I don't know and that, in itself is one of the most important lessons I have learned so far.
